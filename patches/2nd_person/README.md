Generatively plays samples of your playing.

When recording is armed (left footswitch), each continuous chunk of playing is recorded to one of 5 loopers. The patch then triggers these loopers randomly to create a generative sample player.

Additionally each looper has itâ€™s own LFO controlling the volume.

Controls:
Volume range: the spread of the looper volumes
Volume min: the lowest possible looper volume
Looper Repeat: Sets the minimum interval before a looper can be retriggered
Tempo: Controls the rate at which play events are selected
